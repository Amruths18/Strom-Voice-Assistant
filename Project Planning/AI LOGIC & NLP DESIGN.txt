Detailed NLP Components
1. Preprocessing
Lowercasing
Removing noise words
Tokenizing
Lemmatizing (optional)
Extracting keywords

Example:
"Set an alarm for tomorrow at 7am"
Becomes:
["set", "alarm", "tomorrow", "7am"]

2. Intent Classification

List of main intents:

Intent Name	Example Utterances
SET_ALARM	“Set an alarm”
SET_REMINDER	“Remind me”
SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN	“Shut down my PC”
SYSTEM_LOCK	“Lock the system”
OPEN_APP	“Open Chrome”
SEND_MESSAGE	“Send a WhatsApp message”
ASK_QUESTION	“What is AI?”
CHAT	“How are you?”

3. Entity Extraction 

Identifies:
Date
Time
Application name
Contact name
Message content

Example:
“Send message to Rahul saying I’ll come late”
Entities extracted:
contact = Rahul
message = I’ll come late

4. Context Manager

Handles follow-up conversations:
User: "Set a reminder"
Assistant: "Okay, what should I remind you about?"
User: "To call mom"
Context helps link both messages.

5. Command Router

Maps intent → module:

if intent == "SET_ALARM":
    task_manager.set_alarm()
elif intent == "SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN":
    system_control.shutdown()
elif intent == "ASK_QUESTION":
    general_knowledge.answer()

6. AI Conversation Engine

Two modes:
Offline conversation:
Predefined responses
Rule-based logic
Local knowledge
Online conversation:
Uses internet-based search or API
Can provide better quality answers

7. Response Generation
Creates human-like responses:

Examples:
“Your reminder has been set.”
“Opening Chrome.”
“Your system will shut down in 10 seconds.”

8. Text-To-Speech Output
Uses pyttsx3 (offline)
Adjustable voice speed
Male/female voice options
Stable, low-latency
